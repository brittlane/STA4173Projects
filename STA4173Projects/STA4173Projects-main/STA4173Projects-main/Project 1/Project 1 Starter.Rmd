#### 1. Describe the data. 

```{r}
summaries <- data_south_west %>% group_by(Region) %>% 
  summarize(mean00 = mean(`2000`), sd00 = sd(`2000`), median00 = median(`2000`), iqr00 = IQR(`2000`), mean05 = mean(`2005`), sd05 = sd(`2005`), median05= median(`2005`), iqr05= IQR(`2005`), mean10 = mean(`2010`), sd10 = sd(`2010`), median10 = median(`2010`), iqr10 = IQR(`2010`),mean15 = mean(`2015`), sd15 = sd(`2015`), median15 = median(`2015`), iqr15 = IQR(`2015`))

# NOTE -- you must edit the code in this chunk to get the summary statistics for the other years (copy, paste, and edit :-) )
```
  
|       |                           | 2000 | 2005 | 2010 | 2015 |
|-------|---------------------------|------|------|------|------|
| South | Mean (Standard Deviation) | `r round(summaries$mean00[1],2)` (`r round(summaries$sd00[1],2)`)     | `r round(summaries$mean05[1],2)` (`r round(summaries$sd05[1],2)`)   |   `r round(summaries$mean10[1],2)` (`r round(summaries$sd10[1],2)`) |  `r round(summaries$mean15[1],2)` (`r round(summaries$sd15[1],2)`)   |

#### 2. Construct side-by-side boxplots comparing the South and West regions for 2000, 2005, 2010, and 2015.

```{r}
bp00 <- ggplot(data=data_south_west, aes(y= `2000`, x=Region, fill=Region)) +
          geom_boxplot() +
          theme_minimal() +
          labs(y = "Spending", x = "Region") +
          ylim(min=0, max=1500000) +
          ggtitle("2000")

bp05 <- ggplot(data=data_south_west, aes(y= `2005`, x=Region, fill=Region)) +
          geom_boxplot() +
          theme_minimal() +
          labs(y = "Spending", x = "Region") +
          ylim(min=0, max=1500000) +
          ggtitle("2005")

bp10 <- ggplot(data=data_south_west, aes(y= `2010`, x=Region, fill=Region)) +
          geom_boxplot() +
          theme_minimal() +
          labs(y = "Spending", x = "Region") +
          ylim(min=0, max=1500000) +
          ggtitle("2010")
bp15 <- ggplot(data=data_south_west, aes(y= `2015`, x=Region, fill=Region)) +
          geom_boxplot() +
          theme_minimal() +
          labs(y = "Spending", x = "Region") +
          ylim(min=0, max=1500000) +
          ggtitle("2015")

# NOTE -- you must edit the code to be able to construct the final image (below) -- copy, paste, and change values to get the boxplots together, below

ggarrange(bp00, bp05, bp10, bp15, ncol=2, nrow=2)
```
  
#### 3. Describe the distributions. Are they skewed? Do you think there's a difference between the two regions? 
Answer here.
  
#### 4. Use the appropriate *t* test to determine if there is a difference in library spending between the South and West regions in 2005. Test at the &alpha; = 0.05 level. Include the formal test results (including the formal hypotheses), but in your interpretation, make sure that you explain the results such that a non-statistician can understand.
```{r}
t.test(`2005` ~ Region, data=data_south_west, alternative="two")
```
&emsp;&emsp; *H*<sub>0</sub>: &mu;<sub>U</sub>-&mu;<sub>T</sub> =  0 <br>
&emsp;&emsp; *H*<sub>1</sub>:  &mu;<sub>U</sub>-&mu;<sub>T</sub> &ne; 0

**Test Statistic**

&emsp;&emsp; *t*<sub>0</sub> = -0.444.

***p*-value**

&emsp;&emsp; *p* = 0.6628.

**Rejection Region**

&emsp;&emsp; Reject if *p* < &alpha;, where &alpha; = 0.05.

**Conclusion and Interpretation**

&emsp;&emsp Reject *H*<sub>0</sub>. There is sufficient evidence to suggest that spending is different between the south and the west.

  
#### 5. Assess the variance assumption. Test at the &alpha; = 0.05 level. Include the formal test results (including the formal hypotheses), but in your interpretation, make sure that you explain the results such that a non-statistician can understand. Include whether or not the assumption is broken.
```{r}
var.test(`2005` ~ Region, data = data_south_west, alternative = "two.sided")
```
  
#### 6. Assess the normality assumption. In your interpretation, make sure that you explain the results such that a non-statistician can understand. Include whether or not the assumption is broken.

  
#### 7. Use the appropriate nonparam etric test to determine if there is a difference in library spending between the South and West regions in 2005. Test at the &alpha; = 0.05 level. Include the formal test results (including the formal hypotheses), but in your interpretation, make sure that you explain the results such that a non-statistician can understand.
  
#### 8. Based on your answers to 5 and 6, which test should be reported? Explain why you're choosing the test you're choosing. (Hint: you will either choose the *t* test or the nonparametric test.)
  
#### 9. Use the appropriate *t* test to determine if there is a difference in library spending between 2005 and 2010 for all states. Test at the &alpha; = 0.05 level. Include the formal test results (including the formal hypotheses), but in your interpretation, make sure that you explain the results such that a non-statistician can understand.
  
#### 10. Assess the normality assumption. In your interpretation, make sure that you explain the results such that a non-statistician can understand. Include whether or not the assumption is broken.
  
#### 11. Use the appropriate nonparametric test to determine if there is a difference in library spending between 2005 and 2010 for all states. Test at the &alpha; = 0.05 level. Include the formal test results (including the formal hypotheses), but in your interpretation, make sure that you explain the results such that a non-statistician can understand.
  
#### 12. Based on your answers to 10, which test should be reported? Explain why you're choosing the test you're choosing. (Hint: you will either choose the *t* test or the nonparametric test.)
